I was a long time luabind user but I often experienced strange memory bugs that are very hard to debug.
When I noticed there are some subtle problems, it was already too late and I am absolutely convinced 
that there was no way that I can debug those problems. Projects were huge, and those bugs were not reproducible
in small programs. It seemed that they are related to luabind though. 
So recently I developed luna-gen and migrated to it.
And all of those strange bugs are gone. 

I am not suggesting that luabind is buggy, which I don't know for sure. 
What I think is that luabind automates too much by default, and it complicates things. 

I upload here the original luabind version of the bind codes so that you can compare how to use luabind and luna-gen.
